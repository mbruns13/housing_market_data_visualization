# project_3_housing_data

### Project Proposal:

* What is your question you want answered or how you want end users (i.e. the public) to use your site or visualizations: For our project, we wanted to create visualizations that allow people to better ingest Housing Market data without looking at individual listings.

* Data source: This residential real estate data set was created by Redfin, an online real estate brokerage. Published on January 9th, 2022, this data summarize the monthly housing market for every State, Metro, and Zip code in the US from 2012 to 2021. Redfin aggregated this data across multiple listing services and has been gracious enough to include property type in their reporting. Please properly cite and link to RedFin if you end up using this data for your research or project.
