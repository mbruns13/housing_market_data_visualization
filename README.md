# project_3_housing_data

### Project Proposal:

* What is your question you want answered or how you want end users (i.e. the public) to use your site or visualizations. For my project, we wanted to get visualizations that allow people to better ingest Airbnb data without looking at individual listings.

* Data sources

* Initial thoughts on databases you might use (PgAmin/MongoDB)

* Initial ideas for pages or visuals. Obviously, this can change once you start developing.
