# redin_housing_data

## Project Proposal:

### What is your question you want answered or how you want end users (i.e. the public) to use your site or visualizations: 
* For our project, we wanted to create visualizations that allow people to better ingest Housing Market data during the COVID-19 pandemic (2019-2021):
  * Housing prices over time (by County)
  * Housing price by population density (by County)
  * Housing availablility over time (by County)

### Data source 

* Source: RedFin Data Center obtained via kaggle.com. This residential real estate data set was created by Redfin, an online real estate brokerage. Published on January 9th, 2022, this data summarize the monthly housing market for every State and County served by Redfin in the US from 2012 to 2021. Redfin aggregated this data across multiple listing services and has been gracious enough to include property type in their reporting. Please properly cite and link to RedFin if you end up using this data for your research or project.

### Initial ideas for pages or visuals
* Home Page
